Sample Text-to-Speech Engine and MakeVoice

Demonstrates
============
The sample text-to-speech (TTS) engine demonstrates the design, compilation,
installation, and testing for engines. The sample consists of two projects:
AutomationTtsEngine and MakeVoice.

AutomationTtsEngine is the sample engine dll. This is a useful example code for
understanding how a real TTS engine might be implemented.

MakeVoice creates text-to-speech (TTS) voice fonts for sample use. It combines a
series of individually spoken words into a single file. The resulting file is
automatically loaded and you may use it in any TTS application recognizing SAPI
5 voices. MakeVoice is intended to demonstrate making sample voice fonts. The
limited scope is not ideal to create larger, more robust voice samples.
Additionally, extensive error checking or error prevention routines are not
included so that the resulting file may contain conditions not optimal to
superior performance.
 
Sample Language Implementations
===============================
This sample is available in C++.

Readme.txt                              This file.

To build the sample using Visual Studio 2005 or Visual Studio 2008:
==================================================================
    1. Open Windows Explorer and navigate to the directory.
    2. On Windows XP, double-click the icon for the AutomationTtsEngine.sln
       (solution) file to open the file in Visual Studio. On Windows 7 run
       the Visual Studio 2005 (or VS 2008) as administrator by right clicking
       the Visual Studio icon and selecting "Run as administrator". Then open
       the solution file from the "File -> Open -> Project/Solution" menu.
    3. In the Build menu, select Build Solution. The sample engine will be built
       in the "Debug" or "Release" directory for 32-bit platforms, "x64\Debug"
       or "x64\Release" directory for 64-bit platforms. The dll will
       automatically register itself in the Post-Build event of AutomationTtsEngine
       project. The sound font will be installed automatically in the Post-Build
       event of MakeVoice project.
    
To run the sample:
=================
There are various ways to see the sample engine running:
    1. Use the TtsApplication sample which allows you to experiment tts voices.
       Select the "Automation Voice" to use this sample. Or,
    2. Programatically create and use this sample voice. Or,
    3. On Windows 7, go to the "Control Panel -> Ease of Access -> Speech
       Recognition Options -> Text to Speech" and select the "Automation Voice"
       in the voice section. All speech applications will now use this voice.
       As a confirmation of the selection, you will hear the voice speak, "You
       have selected the Sample TTS voice as the computer's default voice."
